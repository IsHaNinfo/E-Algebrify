## Solving by Elimination

The elimination method is used to solve systems of linear equations by eliminating one variable so you can solve for the other. Hereâ€™s how:

### Steps:

1. **Align the equations** so that like terms (variables and constants) are in columns.
2. **Multiply one or both equations (if needed)** to get the coefficients of one variable to be the same or exact opposites.
3. **Add or subtract the equations** to eliminate one variable.
4. **Solve the resulting single-variable equation** for the remaining variable.
5. **Substitute this value back** into one of the original equations to solve for the other variable.
6. **Check your solution** by plugging both values into the original equations.

### Example:

Solve the system:


2x + y = 7 \\
3x - y = 8

---

### Step 1: Add the two equations to eliminate \( y \):

\[
(2x + y) + (3x - y) = 7 + 8
\]

The \( y \) terms cancel out:

\[
2x + y + 3x - y = 15
\]

\[
5x = 15
\]

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( x \):

\[
5x = 15 \implies x = \frac{15}{5} = 3
\]

---

### Step 3: Substitute \( x = 3 \) into one of the original equations (say, the first one) to find \( y \):

\[
2(3) + y = 7
\]

\[
6 + y = 7
\]

\[
y = 7 - 6 = 1
\]

---

### Final solution:

\[
\{
x = 3, \quad y = 1
}
\]

---

### Step 4: Check the solution in the second equation:

\[
3x - y = 8
\]

Substitute \( x = 3 \), \( y = 1 \):

\[
3(3) - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8
\]

True! So the solution is correct.
