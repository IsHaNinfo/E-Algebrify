## Simultaneous Equations


Simultaneous equations are a set of equations containing multiple variables that are solved together to find values that satisfy all equations simultaneously.

### Solving by Substitution

The substitution method involves:
- Solving one equation for one variable.
- ubstituting this expression into the other equation.
- Solving for the remaining variable.


### Steps
1. Make one variable the subject in one equation
2. Substitute this expression into the other equation
3. Solve for the remaining variable
4. Substitute back to find the first variable

### Example 

Solve: 2x + y = 7 \\
       3x - y = 8

* Step 1: From first equation, \( y = 10 - x \)
* Step 2: Substitute into second equation: \( 2x - (10 - x) = 5 \)
* Step 3: Solve: \( 2x - 10 + x = 5 \implies 3x = 15 \implies x = 5 \)
* Step 4: Substitute back: \( y = 10 - 5 = 5 \)
