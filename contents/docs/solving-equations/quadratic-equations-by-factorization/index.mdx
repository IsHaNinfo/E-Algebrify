## Quadratic Equations by Factorization

### Concept

Quadratic equations are of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. We solve them by factorizing the quadratic expression and finding the roots.

### Steps

1. Express in standard form.
2. Factor the expression.
3. Use the zero-product rule: set each factor to zero and solve.

### Example 1

Solve: `x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0`

* Factor: `(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0`
* Set factors to 0 â†’ `x = -2`, `x = -3`

### Example 2

Solve: `x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0`

* Factor: `(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0`
* Roots: `x = 5`, `x = -1`
