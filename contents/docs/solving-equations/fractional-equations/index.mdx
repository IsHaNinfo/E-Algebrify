## Linear Equations in One Variable


A linear equation is an equation of the form `ax + b = c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. The goal is to isolate the variable `x`.

### Steps

1. Simplify both sides if needed.
2. Move variables to one side and constants to the other.
3. Isolate the variable.

### Example 1

Solve: `3x - 5 = 7`

* Step 1: Add 5 to both sides → `3x = 12`
* Step 2: Divide by 3 → `x = 4`

### Example 2

Solve: `2(x - 1) = 4`

* Step 1: Expand → `2x - 2 = 4`
* Step 2: Add 2 → `2x = 6`
* Step 3: Divide by 2 → `x = 3`
