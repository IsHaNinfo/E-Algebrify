## Solving Fractional Equations


Fractional equations include variables in denominators. We clear fractions by multiplying all terms by the Lowest Common Denominator (LCD).

### Steps

1. Identify the LCD.
2. Multiply every term by the LCD to eliminate denominators.
3. Solve the resulting equation.

### Example 1

Solve: `1/(x+1) + 1 = 2`

* Subtract 1 → `1/(x+1) = 1`
* Multiply both sides by `x+1` → `1 = x + 1`
* Solve → `x = 0`

### Example 2

Solve: `(2x + 3)/5 = 1`

* Multiply both sides by 5 → `2x + 3 = 5`
* Subtract 3 → `2x = 2`
* Divide by 2 → `x = 1`
