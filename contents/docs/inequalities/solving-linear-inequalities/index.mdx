# Inequalities

Inequalities are mathematical expressions that show the relationship between two values where one is greater than, less than, or equal to the other.

## Solving Linear Inequalities

### Concept
Linear inequalities are similar to linear equations but use inequality symbols:
- < (less than)
- > (greater than)
- ≤ (less than or equal to)
- ≥ (greater than or equal to)

### Steps
1. Treat the inequality like an equation
2. Remember to reverse the inequality sign when:
   - Multiplying or dividing by a negative number
   - Taking reciprocals of negative numbers

### Example 1
Solve: \( 2x + 3 < 7 \)

* Step 1: Subtract 3 from both sides
  \[ 2x < 4 \]
* Step 2: Divide both sides by 2
  \[ x < 2 \]

### Example 2
Solve: \( -3x > 6 \)

* Step 1: Divide both sides by -3 (remember to reverse the sign)
  \[ x < -2 \]
