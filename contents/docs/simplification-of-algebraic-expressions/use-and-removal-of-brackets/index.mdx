Brackets are used to group terms, but they can be removed by applying the **distributive law**.

### Distributive Law

`a(b + c) = ab + ac`

`3(x+2)=3x+6`

Removing brackets helps you simplify the expression and make calculations easier.

âœ… Tip: Multiply everything inside the bracket by the term outside the bracket.
