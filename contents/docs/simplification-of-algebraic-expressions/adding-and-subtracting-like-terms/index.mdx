## Adding and Subtracting Like Terms

### What Are Like Terms?

- Like terms have the **same variables raised to the same powers**.
- Only **like terms** can be added or subtracted.

### Example

`
4x + 3x - 2x = (4 + 3 - 2)x = 5x
`
### Why Is This Important?

Simplifying expressions by combining like terms makes algebra problems easier to work with.
âœ… Tip: Always group like terms together before adding or subtracting.
