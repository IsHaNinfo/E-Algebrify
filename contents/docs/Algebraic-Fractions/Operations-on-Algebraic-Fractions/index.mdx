## Addition and Subtraction of Algebraic Fractions

### Steps:
1. Find the Lowest Common Denominator (LCD).
2. Rewrite each fraction with the LCD as the denominator.
3. Add or subtract the numerators.

### Example:

`1/x + 1/2 = (2 + x) / 2x`

## Multiplication and Division of Algebraic Fractions

### Multiplication
- Multiply the numerators.
- Multiply the denominators.
- Simplify the result.

### Example:

`2x / 3 * 5 / x = 10 / 3`

### Division
- Multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction.

### Example:

`3x / 4 รท x / 2 = 3x / 4 * 2 / x = 6 / 4 = 3 / 2`
