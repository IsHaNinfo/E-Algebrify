## Solving Fractional Equations

To eliminate fractions:
1. Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all denominators.
2. Multiply each term of the equation by the LCM.
3. Solve the resulting linear or quadratic equation.

### Example:
Solve:
`
1/3 + 2/c = 1
`

Multiply all terms by `3c`:
`
c + 6 = 3c
`

Solve:
`
6 = 2c => c = 3
`
