## Solving Quadratic Equations by Factorization

### Steps:
1. Write the equation in standard form: `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`
2. Factor the quadratic expression.
3. Set each factor equal to 0 and solve.

### Example:
Solve:
`
x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0
`

Factor:
`
(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
`

Solve each factor:
`
x = -2, x = -3
`
