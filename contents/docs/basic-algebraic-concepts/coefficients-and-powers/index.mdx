## Coefficients
A **coefficient** is the number multiplied by a variable in a term.

### Example:
In the term `7a^2`, the coefficient is `7`.

## Powers (Exponents)
A **power** (or **exponent**) tells us how many times to multiply a number by itself.

### Example:
`a^2` means `a Ã— a`.

This concept is essential when simplifying and evaluating algebraic expressions.
