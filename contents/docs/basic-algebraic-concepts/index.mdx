## Let's Dive into Basic Algebra!
Welcome to the exciting world of algebra! Don't worry if it sounds a bit intimidating; we're going to break it down into easy-to-understand pieces. Algebra is simply a way to use letters (called variables) and symbols to represent numbers and relationships in math. It's like a secret code that helps us solve all sorts of problems!

In this topic, we'll uncover the foundational concepts that make up the backbone of algebra. By the end, you'll be comfortable with:

- Variables, Constants, and Terms: What are these building blocks of algebraic expressions?
- Coefficients and Powers: How do numbers and exponents interact with our variables?
