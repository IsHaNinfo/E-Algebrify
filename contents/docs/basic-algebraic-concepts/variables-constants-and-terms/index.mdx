title: Variables, Constants, and Terms
description: Understand the fundamental components of algebraic expressions including variables, constants, and terms.

## Variables
A **variable** is a symbol (usually a letter like `x`, `y`, `a`, etc.) that represents a number which can change.

## Constants
A **constant** is a fixed value that does not change.

## Terms
A **term** is a single mathematical expression made up of variables, constants, and/or powers, connected by multiplication or division.

### Example
In the algebraic expression `3x + 5`:

- `3x` is a term (made of 3 and x)
- `5` is a constant
- `x` is a variable
- `3` is a coefficient
