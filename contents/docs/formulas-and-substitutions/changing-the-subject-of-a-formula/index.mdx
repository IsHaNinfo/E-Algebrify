##  Changing the Subject of a Formula

### Concept

Changing the subject means rearranging a formula to isolate a different variable on the left side.

### Steps

1. Identify the variable to be made the subject.
2. Apply inverse operations to isolate that variable.

### Example 1

Given `A = bh`, make `h` the subject.

* Divide both sides by `b`: `h = A / b`

### Example 2

Given `v = u + at`, make `t` the subject.

* Subtract `u`: `v - u = at`
* Divide by `a`: `t = (v - u)/a`
