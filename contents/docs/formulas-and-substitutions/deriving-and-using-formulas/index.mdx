## Deriving and Using Formulas


Formulas express relationships between variables. You can derive a formula by rearranging or combining known equations. Once derived, you can use it for various problems.

### Example 1

Given `Speed = Distance / Time (v = d/t)`, derive the formula for Distance.

* Multiply both sides by `t`: `d = v × t`

Use: If `v = 60 km/h` and `t = 2 hours`, then `d = 60 × 2 = 120 km`

### Example 2

Area of triangle: `A = (1/2) × b × h`

* Use: If `b = 10`, `h = 5`, then `A = (1/2) × 10 × 5 = 25`
