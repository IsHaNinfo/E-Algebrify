## Simplifying Expressions
By combining the laws of exponents, we can simplify complex expressions involving powers.

### Example 1
Simplify:

`
2^3 Ã— 2^2 Ã· 2^4
`

Step-by-step:

`
= 2^{3+2-4} = 2^1 = 2
`

### Example 2
Simplify:

`
(3^2)^3 Ã· 3^4
`

Step-by-step:

`
= 3^{2Ã—3} Ã· 3^4 = 3^{6-4} = 3^2 = 9
`

ðŸ§  **Tip:** Apply product, quotient, and power rules together for multi-step simplification.
