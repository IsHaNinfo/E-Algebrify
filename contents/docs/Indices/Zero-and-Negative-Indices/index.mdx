## Zero Exponent Rule
Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

`
a^0 = 1 (a â‰  0)
`

### Example
`
7^0 = 1, (-3)^0 = 1
`

## Negative Exponent Rule
A negative exponent means taking the reciprocal of the base with a positive exponent.

`
a^(-n) = 1/(a^n)
`

### Example
`
2^(-3) = 1/(2^3) = 1/8  and  (1/5)^(-2) = 5^2 = 25
`
