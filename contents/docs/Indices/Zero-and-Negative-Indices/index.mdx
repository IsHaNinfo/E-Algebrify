## Zero Exponent Rule
Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

`
a^0 = 1 \quad (a â‰  0)
`

### Example
`
7^0 = 1, \quad (-3)^0 = 1
`

## Negative Exponent Rule
A negative exponent means taking the reciprocal of the base with a positive exponent.

`
a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}
`

### Example
`
2^{-3} = \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}
\quad\text{and}\quad\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{-2} = 5^2 = 25
`
