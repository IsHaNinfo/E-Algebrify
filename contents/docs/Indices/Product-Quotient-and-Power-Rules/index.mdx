## Product Rule
When multiplying powers with the same base, **add** the exponents:

`
a^m × a^n = a^{m+n}
`

### Example
`
3^2 × 3^4 = 3^{2+4} = 3^6
`

## Quotient Rule
When dividing powers with the same base, **subtract** the exponents:

`
a^m ÷ a^n = a^{m-n}
`

### Example
`
5^5 ÷ 5^2 = 5^{5-2} = 5^3
`

## Power Rule
When raising a power to another power, **multiply** the exponents:

`
(a^m)^n = a^{m×n}
`

### Example
`
(2^3)^2 = 2^{3×2} = 2^6
`
