## Difference of Two Squares

The identity used here is:

`
a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)
`

This method is applicable only when:
- There are exactly two terms.
- Both terms are perfect squares.
- They are separated by a minus sign.

### Example
Factor the expression:
`
x^2 - 16
`

Solution:
`
x^2 - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4)
`
