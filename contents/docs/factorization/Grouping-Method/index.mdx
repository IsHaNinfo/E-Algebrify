## Grouping Method

This method involves grouping terms with common factors and factoring each group.

### Steps
1. Group terms in pairs.
2. Factor out the GCF from each group.
3. Look for a common binomial factor.

### Example
Factor:
`
ax + ay + bx + by
`

Group terms:
`
(ax + ay) + (bx + by)
`

Factor each group:
`
a(x + y) + b(x + y)
`

Factor out the common binomial:
`
(a + b)(x + y)
`
