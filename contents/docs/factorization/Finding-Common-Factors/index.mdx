## Finding Common Factors

To factor out common terms from an expression, identify the **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)** of the terms involved.

### Steps
1. Identify common numerical and variable factors.
2. Factor out the GCF.

### Example
Factor the expression:
`
6x + 9
`
- The GCF of 6 and 9 is 3.

So:
`
6x + 9 = 3(2x + 3)
`
