## What is Factorization?

Factorization means expressing an algebraic expression as a product of its factors. It's a way to break down expressions into simpler parts that can be multiplied to get the original expression.

This technique is widely used to simplify equations, solve algebraic problems, and identify relationships among terms.

### Example

The expression:
`
6x + 9
`
can be factorized as:
`
3(2x + 3)
`
where 3 is the common factor.
