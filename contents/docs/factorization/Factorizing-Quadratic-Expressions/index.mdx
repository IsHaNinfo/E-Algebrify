## Factorizing Quadratic Expressions

We focus on quadratic expressions of the form:
`
ax^2 + bx + c
`

### Steps (When a = 1)
1. Find two numbers that multiply to give **c** and add to give **b**.
2. Use those numbers to write the factors.

### Example
Factor:
`
x^2 + 5x + 6
`
- Find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5 â†’ 2 and 3.

So:

`
x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)
`
